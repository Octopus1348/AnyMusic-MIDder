# AnyMusic-MIDder
A very simple script to download music from YouTube and convert it to MIDI. The name might sound familiar if you've looked into Wii Homebrew apps, and that's because the name inspiration is from AnyTitle-Deleter. I didn't bother to give a better name.

# Installation (Linux)
Install yt-dlp from your distro's repo and run install.sh. Note that you will get a pre-built binary compiled for x86 64-bit.
If you have any other *nix OS, find the dependencies for that and install it/compile from source.
